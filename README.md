OrthoRobot
========

Modified and improved version of stabyourself.net's OrthoRobot.
Get the original from [here](http://stabyourself.net/orthorobot/ "stabyourself.net")

You need [Love2d](http://love2d.org "Love2d") to run this game.

This has been updated to work with LOVE 0.8.0, but the version at the site only supports an earlier version.


Until the game supports multiple resolutions and an options screen has been created to support this, 
the game defaults to fullscreen for easier development on my side.
However, you can press the "f" key during the intro (also skips the intro) to go into windowed mode.
