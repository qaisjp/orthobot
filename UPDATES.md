More updates coming soon


Saturday 9th March; 7:11pm GMT+-0
-------------------------------------------
Changes:
 - Created easy controls, this allows you to just move the mouse to
rotate (instead of holding down the mouse)
 - Small (2px) cursor movements are ignored
 - Moved the toggle sound to the bottom so that it doesn't bug out on
Mac (fullscreen bug)

Bugs to fix:
 - The 3d interface jitters when you move the mouse off the screen
boundary.
    INFO: This is because the mouse skips a few units at the boundaries.
    SOLUTION: Blending positioning (impossible to get choppyness), this
also allows for a better camera.

Features soon:
 - Create option window
      - Option and support for fullscreen
      - Option to turn off the easy controls
- High scores
