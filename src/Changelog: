Defaults to fullscreen for easier development on my side, but you can press the "f" key during the intro (also skips the intro) to go into windowed mode.

Changes:


Bugs to fix:
 - The 3d interface jitters when you move the mouse off the screen boundary.
    INFO: This is because the mouse skips a few units at the boundaries.
    SOLUTION: Blending positioning (impossible to get choppyness), this also allows for a better camera.

Features soon:
 - Create option window
      - Option and support for fullscreen
      - Option to turn off the easy controls
- High scores
